- Generate rules more efficiently.
    - Support bound on number of non-empty boxes.
- Framework for tests.
- The XX-overlay rule for Av(123) also comes up for Av(231)
- Can we order the output of the exact cover by the number of rules glued?


DONE:
- Preprocess binary strings. Don't do set cover over the same binary string many times. (done in new algorithm)
- Implement Algorithm X for exact cover. DONE!
- We can't seem to be able to do perm_prop = lambda p: p.avoids([1])
  WE DO NOW!
- I get maximum recursion depth exceeded when working with classical
  patterns of length 4. NOT ANYMORE!
- In some cases the exact cover algorithm is slowing things down
  (Happens rarely)
- Rewrite OrderedSetPartitions without all the sets. Benchmark and see if it is faster. (IT WAS!!)
- When we search for 1x1 rules for Av(231) we only get the rule |I| but should also get |Av(231)|
