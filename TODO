- Generate rules more efficiently.
    - Support bound on number of non-empty boxes.
- Framework for tests.
- When we search for 1x1 rules for Av(231) we only get the rule |I| but should also get |Av(231)|


DONE:
- Rewrite OrderedSetPartitions without all the sets. Benchmark and see if it is faster. (IT WAS!!)
