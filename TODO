- Generate rules more efficiently.
    - Support bound on number of non-empty boxes.
- Framework for tests.
- Preprocess binary strings. Don't do set cover over the same binary string many times. (done in new algorithm)
- Implement Algorithm X for exact cover.


DONE:
- Rewrite OrderedSetPartitions without all the sets. Benchmark and see if it is faster. (IT WAS!!)
